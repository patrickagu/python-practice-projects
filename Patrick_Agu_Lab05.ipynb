Regular expressions enables us to extract specific patterns (pattern matching), briefly or concisely in a single expression, without having to manually iterate over the text unlike user defined functions. They are used to retrieve different types of patterns from text, patterns like URLs, email addresses, phone numbers etc. \n",
